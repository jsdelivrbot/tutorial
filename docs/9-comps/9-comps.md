## Lab 9: Develop in the cloud for speed

1. You can develop faster if you let a server in the cloud do the heavy lifting of compiling, building and deploying your code. This is why we created a build server infrastructure, named _META_. This tutorial will show how to set up and use it. Once you go META, you'll never go back (to development on your desktop).

2. Go to  <a href='https://codeanywhere.com' target='_blank'>Code Anywhere</a> and sign up for free. Validate your account from the email you will receive (important). In the Editor, select "File-New Connection-DigitalOcean" and copy the $10 coupon code. Then go to <a href='https://www.digitalocean.com' target='_blank'>Digital Ocean</a>, create an account, and apply the coupon on the "Billing" page. Do not create a droplet at Digital Ocean.

3. In Codeanywhere, go to File-New Connection-Digital Ocean. Select a 1GB machine at the location nearest to you. From the list of images, choose `Docker... on 16.04`. As hostname, enter `dockermeta1` or another hostname of your choice. Ensure that "Codeanywhere SSH Key" is checked, then click 'Create'. You will be prompted for your Digital Ocean credentials. 

4. When the connection is available in the left pane, rightclick to open an SSH Terminal. On the command line, enter `docker pull nbake/nbake:latest`. This will download the META docker image. Then enter `docker run -d --privileged -p 20-21:20-21 -p 8080-8082:8080-8082 nbake/nbake /sbin/my_init` to start the app on ports 8080 and 8081. Type `docker ps` to get the CONTAINER ID (e.g. b6fbd9d948eb). Finally, enter `docker exec -ti xCONTAINER-IDx /bin/bash` to get to the docker container console. You can list the files in the docker container with `ls -la`.

5. The admin app we are about to install will use FTP to access the site you wish to administer. In previous tutorials, you will have installed the Blog project to CDN77, but you can connect to any hosting environment that supports FTP. In CDN77, get the FTP connection info (host, user and pass) under CDN - CDN-Storages by clicking on the CDN STORAGE LABEL. In the Codeanywhere docker console, enter `sshfs -o allow_other xUSERx@xHOSTx:/www/ /home/admin/mnt` to mount it. Omit `www/` if your site is at the root of the FTP. Enter the pass when prompted. [Use `umount -f /home/admin/mnt` if you need to unmount this.] You can verify your successful mounts with ` ps aux | grep -i sftp | grep -v grep`.

6. Create a <a href='https://github.com' target='_blank'>github account</a> if you don't have one. In Codeanywhere File-New Connection-Github, get the contents of <a href='https://github.com/topseed/meta-admin-ex' target='_blank'>topseed/meta-admin-ex</a>. Open `/exMeta2/admin.yaml`, set `mount` to `/home/admin/mnt/` and `srv_www` to `/home/admin/www_admin/`, and save. [TODO: this should be the default]. If you like, you can change the `secret` (password); you will use it to access the admin app later.

7. [TODO nbake -a] Docker has a user named 'admin'. Back in the Codeanywhere docker console, type `passwd admin` to change its password. Start an FTP server in docker with `nohup vsftpd&`. This FTP server will have the folder `/admin` as its root. In Codeanywhere File-New Connection-FTP, establish a plain FTP connection to the Droplet IP address on port 21 with username `admin` and the password you specified. Copy/paste (via rightclick) the contents of the folder `/exMeta2` including the edited `admin.yaml` to the FTP root folder (which represents `/admin` in the docker container). In the docker console, install node modules with `npm i`. Then start the admin app with `node index .` (The `.` dot at the end is important).

7. In your browser, the admin app should now be available at http://[Droplet IP]:8081
You can trigger a bake with http://[Droplet IP]:8081/api/bake?secret=123&folder=/myfolder
