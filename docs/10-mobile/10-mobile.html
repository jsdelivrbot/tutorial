<h2 id="lab-10-mobile-app-phonegap-">Lab 10: Mobile App (Phonegap)</h2>
<ol>
<li><p>In this lab we will customize and install an Android app that uses the <em>Cordova In-App Browser</em> to provide a rich UI. Download and unzip <code>topseed-mobile-master.zip</code> from <a href='https://github.com/topseed/topseed-mobile' target='_blank'>https://github.com/topseed/topseed-mobile</a> to your location of choice on your developer machine. Open the project in VS Code. Download, install and run the Phonegap Desktop App from <a href='https://github.com/phonegap/phonegap-app-desktop/releases' target='_blank'>https://github.com/phonegap/phonegap-app-desktop/releases</a>. In Phonegap Desktop, add the <code>/topseed-mobile</code> folder as a Project, and click the &#39;&gt;&#39; button. A message &#39;Server is running on ...&#39; should come up. Click on the URL to open the App in a browser. Resize the browser to mobile phone format. </p>
</li>
<li><p>The app is configured to show a splash screen and then display content obtained from <code>https://m.appthings.io</code>. We will make it display the content you published to the CDN in <a href="./3-goLive/">Lab 3</a> instead. As you edit the project, the Phonegap Desktop App watches for changes in the <code>/www</code> folder of the project and attempts to refresh the browser view on each change. In <code>/www/js/index.js</code>, replace the URL following <code>&#39;window.open</code>&#39; with the homepage URL of the helloworld app you deployed in Lab 3, i.e. your equivalent of <code>https://staging.mydomain.com/page/one/index.html</code>. If you only deployed to the CDN or <code>zeit.co</code>, use your equivalent of <code>https://1234567890.rsc.cdn77.org/page/one/index.html</code>. or <code>https://demos-oosnsyzlphl.now.sh/page/one/index.html</code>. If you never deployed, you can use the published version of this tutorial at <code>https://docs.topseed.io/tutorial/0-agenda/index.html</code>. We include <code>&#39;/index.html&#39;</code> in the path to ensure we deliver the turbo (non-AMP) version of the page.</p>
</li>
<li><p>To allow the in-app browser to navigate to the newly configured URL, in <code>/config.xml</code> <code>&lt;allow-navigation href=&quot;https://m.appthings.io/*&quot; &gt;</code>, replace <code>&#39;m.appthings.io&#39;</code> with your equivalent from the previous step. The app should now display your site at the 
Phonegap Desktop App Server URL. It is a labor of love to replace the splash screen logo (at <code>/www/css/index.css</code>) and the icons used by the phone operating system (see <code>/config.xml</code> <code>&#39;icon&#39;</code> values) with your own; we will skip over it here. Optional: change the values for the app &#39;name&#39; and &#39;version&#39; in <code>/config.xml</code>.</p>
</li>
<li><p>To install the customized app on an Android phone, 
first create a zip file of the contents of the project folder <code>/topseed-mobile</code>. Create an account and login at <a href='https://build.phonegap.com' target='_blank'>https://build.phonegap.com</a>. 
On the &#39;Apps&#39; tab at <a href='https://build.phonegap.com/apps' target='_blank'>https://build.phonegap.com/apps</a>, click the &#39;+ new app&#39; button and upload the zip file (If your project is in Github, you can use the github clone URL instead). The site will take a few moments to build the app. Meanwhile, also log into <a href='https://build.phonegap.com' target='_blank'>https://build.phonegap.com</a> on your mobile phone. Once the build has completed, on your phone download, install and run the version for your phone&#39;s operating system (here: Android). Follow the installation prompts. Done! For fun, close the app and reopen it by tapping on the app icon on your phone UI.</p>
</li>
<li><p>See <a href='http://docs.phonegap.com/' target='_blank'>http://docs.phonegap.com/</a> for further information about phonegap, for instruction how to deploy to Apple iOS,and how your app can access phone-specific APIs, such as address book, location information etc if necessary. We would use a <em>service worker</em> to support offline-browsing as needed.</p>
</li>
<li><p>In this lab we used the Cordova In-App Browser to render app content from a CDN. As shown in <a href="./7-write/">Lab 7</a>, the app can also obtain data securely from separate API servers. Thanks to AppShell, Turbo and caching introduced in <a href="./4-appShell/">Lab 4</a>, the app has a smooth single page application feel. As a result, we were able to develop a rich mobile app without requiring any special Android SDK/iOS development skills. </p>
