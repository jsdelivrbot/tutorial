## Lab 10: Mobile App (Phonegap)

1. In this lab we will customize and install an Android app that uses the _Cordova In-App Browser_ to provide a rich UI. Download and unzip `topseed-mobile-master.zip` from <a href='https://github.com/topseed/topseed-mobile' target='_blank'>https://github.com/topseed/topseed-mobile</a> to your location of choice on your developer machine. Open the project in VS Code. Download, install and run the Phonegap Desktop App from <a href='https://github.com/phonegap/phonegap-app-desktop/releases' target='_blank'>https://github.com/phonegap/phonegap-app-desktop/releases</a>. In Phonegap Desktop, add the `/topseed-mobile` folder as a Project, and click the '>' button. A message 'Server is running on...' should come up. Click on the URL to open the app in a browser. Resize the browser to mobile phone format. 

2. The app is configured to show a splash screen and then display content obtained from `https://m.appthings.io`. We will make it display the content you published to the CDN in [Lab 3](./3-goLive/) instead. As you edit the project, the Phonegap Desktop App watches for changes in the `/www` folder of the project and attempts to refresh the browser view on each change. In `/www/js/index.js`, replace the URL following `'window.open`' with the homepage URL of the helloworld app you deployed in Lab 3, i.e. your equivalent of `https://staging.mydomain.com/page/one/index.html`. If you only deployed to the CDN or `zeit.co`, use your equivalent of `https://1234567890.rsc.cdn77.org/page/one/index.html`. or `https://demos-oosnsyzlphl.now.sh/page/one/index.html`. If you never deployed, you can use the published version of this tutorial at `https://docs.topseed.io/tutorial/0-agenda/index.html`. By including `'/index.html'` in the path we ensure to deliver the turbo (non-AMP) version of the page with its smoother transitions and rich client app feel.

3. To allow the in-app browser to navigate to the newly configured URL, in `/config.xml` `<allow-navigation href="https://m.appthings.io/*" >`, replace `'m.appthings.io'` with your equivalent from the previous step. The app should now display your site at the 
Phonegap Desktop App Server URL. It is a labor of love to replace the splash screen logo (at `/www/css/index.css`) and the icons used by the phone operating system (see `/config.xml` `'icon'` values) with your own; we will skip over it here. Optional: change the values for the app `'name'` and `'version'` in `/config.xml`.

4. To install the customized app on an Android phone, 
first create a zip file of the contents of the project folder `/topseed-mobile`. Create an account and login at <a href='https://build.phonegap.com' target='_blank'>https://build.phonegap.com</a>. 
On the 'Apps' tab at <a href='https://build.phonegap.com/apps' target='_blank'>https://build.phonegap.com/apps</a>, click the '+ new app' button and upload the zip file (If your project is in Github, you can use the Github clone URL instead). The site will take a few moments to build the app. Meanwhile, also log into <a href='https://build.phonegap.com' target='_blank'>https://build.phonegap.com</a> on your mobile phone. Once the build has completed, on your phone download, install and run the version for your phone's operating system (here: Android). Follow the installation prompts. Done! For fun, close the app and reopen it by tapping on the app icon on your phone UI.

5. See <a href='http://docs.phonegap.com/' target='_blank'>http://docs.phonegap.com/</a> for further information about phonegap, for instruction how to deploy to Apple iOS, and how your app can access phone-specific APIs, such as address book, location information etc. if necessary. We would use a _service worker_ to support offline-browsing as needed.

6. In this lab we used the Cordova In-App Browser to render app content from a CDN. As shown in [Lab 7](./7-write/), the app can also obtain data securely from separate API servers. Thanks to AppShell, Turbo and caching introduced in [Lab 4](./4-appShell/), the app has a smooth single page application feel. As a result, we were able to develop a rich mobile app without requiring any special Android SDK/iOS development skills.
